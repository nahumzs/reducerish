 *
 * (actions, hasLogger, interceptors) =>
 * @param {{[key]:(state, payload)=> nextState}}   actions         An object with {key: value} format that define an action of an state
 * @param {boolean}                                hasLogger       Allowed to print a friendly log with the previous and next action
 * @param {{[key]:(state, payload)=> nextState}}   interceptors    An object with {key: value} which allows inversion of control by extending the actions object
 *
 * @return (state, actions) => (state, action) => {...}
 *
 * @param {unknown}                                state           The current state of the useReducer state can be anything
 * @param {{key: {type:string, payload:unknown}}}  action          The action to be handle by the reducer and redirected to the their respective actions
 *
 * @return {unknown} nextState

/**
 * Summary: Reducerish permits to implement inversion of control without exposing the internal reducer and instead allowing the consumer to
 *          extend its current action object, this has three benefits:
 *
 * First:   Abstract the concept of a reducer so the developer doesn't have to deal with
 * Second:  Is quite simple to understand the concept of function and it's easy to explain to another developer that to override a function
 *          has to declare another function with the same name, this is pretty common to do in OOP.
 * Third:   In order to achieve inversion of control the library doesn't requires to export their internal reducer to the consumer
 *          instead is transparent to them by simply overriding the already created actions.
 *          In case duplication exists a third parameter will be sent to the action (state, payload, nextState) is
 *          which is a function that the consumer can executed to generate the default nextState value that the component would generate
 *          if wouldn't be intercepted.
