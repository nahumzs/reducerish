        <h1>{r}</h1>
        <p>
          <code>{rur}</code> is an awesome hook but more often than not it is
          overshadow by its relative <code>{rus}</code> which is easier and
          simple to use.
        </p>
        <p>Personally, I think is mostly by some of the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Reducers are not the bread and butter of all react-developers unlike
            <code>{rus}</code>. This make it a harder pattern to memorize.
          </li>
          <li>
            Apart from simple examples <code>{rur}</code> requires some
            boilerplate to make it functional.
          </li>
          <li>
            To make it consumable across different components you need to pair
            it with the <code>{rc}</code> and you will need more boilerplate to
            use it.
          </li>
          <li>
            And because all above, our beloved
            <code>{rus}</code> is picked first than <code>{rur}</code> each time
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To mitigate some of these reasons, I created <code>{r}</code> (simple
          reducer) which is a simple wrapper on top of <code>{rur}</code>,
          making it easier to use and with a more friendly approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>{r}</code> provides two hooks that you can consume{" "}
          <code>{ur}</code> and <code>{urw}</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok, showtime, these are a basic example for
          <code>{ur}</code> and a more elaborated one for <code>{urw}</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>{ur}</strong>:
        </p>
        <UseReducerish.Story />
        <p>
          <strong>{urw}</strong>:
        </p>
        <UseReducerishWithContext.Story />
        <h2>DEV-UX</h2>
        <p>
          Using <code>{r}</code> comes with some perks from the developer
          experience side of things. As example includes a Logger, types,
          allowed you to customize the displayName of the reducer and finally
          also allow you to make use of "inversion of control" with minimal
          effort.
        </p>
        <h3>hasLogger</h3>
        <p>
          When enable on <code>{ur}</code> or <code>{urw}</code> will print on
          the <em>dev console</em> their previous and next state each time an
          actions is executed, providing the consumer with a nicer picture of
          what it's happening with their state.
        </p>
        <Snippets snippet="hasLogger" />
        <p>this is what you can expect to see in you dev console:</p>
        <img src="./logger.gif" alt="Logger" width="100%" />
        <h3>Types</h3>
        <p>
          In previous examples you saw me explicitly typing the name of the
          action in order to dispatch it <code>dispatch("up")</code> or{" "}
          <code>dispatch("add", value)</code> this is fine but prone to typing
          errors. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Both hooks provides a way to access their types via a third value
          while destructuring their hooks <code>[state, dispatch, types]</code>.{" "}
          {r}'s types get create by taking the <strong>functions</strong> name
          pass-down via the action object.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make use of the types help you as well at the moment of renaming or
          refactoring your code since it's easier to find and replace.
        </p>
        <Snippets snippet="types" />
        <h2>What about async functions and {r}</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Async</em> functions are not different or special for{" "}
          <strong>{r}</strong>, You can keep using async functions as you were
          doing it before with <strong>{rur}</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Saying that here is a small example about how to handle this scenario
          either with <strong>{rur}</strong> or <strong>{r}</strong>. Also worth
          nothing that there is nothing preventing you from using{" "}
          <code>{r}</code> with popular Libraries like{" "}

            <styles.FAQQ>Why did I coded this?</styles.FAQQ>
            <styles.FAQA>
              As I described in the beginning of the page one of the main reason
              was to make <code>{rur}</code> more approachable to any developer
              independently from their expertise level. <br />
              But also, I did it because I'm a library author and having the
              power of reducers without introducing a peer-dependency in your
              library, is quite nice and also mitigate some of the hassles for
              your consumers when consuming your Components ðŸ˜¸. And lastly and
              more important in advances cases is that {r} provides a way to
              implemented <strong>Inversion of control</strong> in a simple way,
              without forcing you to export a reducer, neither to learn
              convolute approaches. <strong>wip ("example to be added")</strong>

            <styles.FAQA>
              No, <code>{r}</code> is just a wrapper on top of{" "}
              <code>{rur}</code> that's all, React is still in charge of the
              state.

              Do this wrapper is a replacement for REDUX?
            </styles.FAQQ>
            <styles.FAQA>
              No, This is just a small package catering to small and medium
              components where <code>{rur}</code> plays better than regular{" "}
              <code>{rus}</code>; Remember is just <code>{rur}</code> with some
              sparkles on top of it âœ¨. <br />
              <strong>Redux</strong> instead is a battle tested library with a

              The React's documentation put it like this:
            </styles.FAQA>
            <blockquote>
              useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex
              state logic that involves{" "}
              <styles.Marker>multiple sub-values</styles.Marker> or{" "}
              <styles.Marker>
                when the next state depends on the previous one
              </styles.Marker>
              . useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components
              that <styles.Marker>trigger deep updates</styles.Marker> because
              you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.
