        <h1>{s}</h1>
        <p>
          <code>{rur}</code> is an awesome hook but more often than not it is
          overshadow by its relative <code>{rus}</code> which is easier and
          simple to use.
        </p>
        <p>Personally, I think is mostly by some of the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Reducers are not the bread and butter of all react-developers unlike
            <code>{rus}</code>. This make it a harder pattern to memorize.
          </li>
          <li>
            Apart from simple examples <code>{rur}</code> requires some
            boilerplate to make it functional.
          </li>
          <li>
            To make it consumable across different components you need to pair
            it with the <code>{rc}</code> and you will need more boilerplate to
            use it.
          </li>
          <li>
            And because all above, our beloved
            <code>{rus}</code> is picked first than <code>{rur}</code> each time
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To mitigate some of these reasons, I created <code>{s}</code> (simple
          reducer) which is a simple wrapper on top of <code>{rur}</code>,
          making it easier to use and with a more friendly approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>{s}</code> provides two hooks that you can consume{" "}
          <code>{us}</code> and <code>{usw}</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok, showtime, these are a basic example for
          <code>{us}</code> and a more elaborated one for <code>{usw}</code>.

        <h2>Reusability</h2>
        <p>
          Reusing components and features within the React ecosystem is a
          complex topic, there are many patterns and ways to make your
          components reusable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>{s}</code> in specific use the state reduce pattern, this
          patterns is best suitable for complex component or small features.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The recipe for <code>{us}</code> is the following:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Export a hook initializing your <strong>reducer</strong> with{" "}
          <code>{us}</code>
        </p>
        <Code
          code={`import { useSeducer } from "@paprika/seducer";

const actions = {
  up(state, payload) {...};
  down(state, payload) {...};
  setCounter(state, payload) {...};
}

const initialState = { counter: 0, ...more}

export function useYourComponent() {
  const store = useSeducer(actions, initialState)
  return store;
}
        `}
        />
        <p>2. Create your reusable component:</p>
        <Code
          code={`import { useSeducer } from "@paprika/seducer";

const actions = {
  up(state, payload) {...};
  down(state, payload) {...};
  setCounter(state, payload) {...};
}

const initialState = { counter: 0, ...more}

export function useYourComponent() {
  const store = useSeducer(actions, initialState)
  return store;
}

export default YourReusableComponent({ store: storeProps, ...moreProps }) {
  const storeDefault = useYourComponent();
  const [state, dispatch, types] = storeProps || storeDefault;

  return (
    <>
      <span>{state.counter}</span>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(types.up)}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(types.down)}>-</button>
    </>
  )
}
        `}
        />
        <p>3. Make use of your Reusable component</p>
        <Code
          code={`import YourReusableComponent from "./YourReusableComponent";

export default App() {
  // this should work without passing a store because it will create one 
  // by default, this is similar to what it's known as a uncontrolled component
  return <YourReusableComponent />
}
        `}
        />
        <p>4. Control your Reusable component </p>
        <Code
          code={`import YourReusableComponent, { useYourComponent } from "./YourReusableComponent";

export default App() {
  const store = useYourComponent();
  const [state, dispatch, types] = store;
  
  return (
    <>
      <YourReusableComponent store={store} />
      <button onClick={()=>{
        const next = state.counter === 0 ? 1 : 2 * state.counter;
        dispatch(types.setCounter, next)
      }}>duplicate</button>
    </>
  )
}`}
        />
        <p>
          <strong>
            The recipe for <code>{usw}</code> is the following:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Similarly to <code>{us}</code> start by defining the basic
          structure:
        </p>
        <Code
          code={`import { useSeducerWithContext } from "@paprika/seducer";

export const actions = { ... };
export const initialState = { ... };

// unlike useSeducer you don't need to expose a default store because that is a Providers' responsibility.
`}
        />
        <ReusabilityWithContext />
        <p>
          Normally you would want to make your component controlled and
          uncontrolled at same time. With <code>{rur}</code> and
          <code>hooks</code> this can be done by exposing via an hook the state
          and the dispatch function from your component, so the consumer can
          fire actions and adjust the behaviour of your component:
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a look to the of the following simple component name{" "}
          <code>{`<CharactersList />`}</code> that can swap characters between
          two lists:
        </p>
        <Reusability />
        <p>
          Now let's make use of the <code>useCharacterList</code> hook to
          controlled the component
        </p>
        <ReusabilityControlled />
        <h2>Inversion of Control</h2>
        <UseReducerishInversionOfControl />
        <h2>DEV-UX</h2>
        <p>
          Using <code>{s}</code> comes with some perks from the developer
          experience side of things. As example includes a Logger, types,
          allowed you to customize the displayName of the reducer and finally
          also allow you to make use of "inversion of control" with minimal
          effort.
        </p>
        <h3>hasLogger</h3>
        <p>
          When enable on <code>{us}</code> or <code>{usw}</code> will print on
          the <em>dev console</em> their previous and next state each time an
          actions is executed, providing the consumer with a nicer picture of
          what it's happening with their state.
        </p>
        <Snippets snippet="hasLogger" />
        <p>this is what you can expect to see in you dev console:</p>
        <img src="./logger.gif" alt="Logger" width="100%" />
        <h3>Types</h3>
        <p>
          In previous examples you saw me explicitly typing the name of the
          action in order to dispatch it <code>dispatch("up")</code> or{" "}
          <code>dispatch("add", value)</code> this is fine but prone to typing
          errors. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Both hooks provides a way to access their types via a third value
          while destructuring their hooks <code>[state, dispatch, types]</code>.{" "}
          {s}'s types get create by taking the <strong>functions</strong> name
          pass-down via the action object.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make use of the types help you as well at the moment of renaming or
          refactoring your code since it's easier to find and replace.
        </p>
        <Snippets snippet="types" />
        <h2>What about async functions and {s}</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Async</em> functions are not different or special for{" "}
          <strong>{s}</strong>, You can keep using async functions as you were
          doing it before with <strong>{rur}</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Saying that here is a small example about how to handle this scenario
          either with <strong>{rur}</strong> or <strong>{s}</strong>. Also worth
          nothing that there is nothing preventing you from using{" "}
          <code>{s}</code> with popular Libraries like{" "}

            <styles.FAQQ>Why did I coded this?</styles.FAQQ>
            <styles.FAQA>
              As I described in the beginning of the page one of the main reason
              was to make <code>{rur}</code> more approachable to any developer
              independently from their expertise level. <br />
              But also, I did it because I'm a library author and having the
              power of reducers without introducing a peer-dependency in your
              library, is quite nice and also mitigate some of the hassles for
              your consumers when consuming your Components 😸. And lastly and
              more important in advances cases is that {s} provides a way to
              implemented <strong>Inversion of control</strong> in a simple way,
              without forcing you to export a reducer, neither to learn
              convolute approaches. <strong>wip ("example to be added")</strong>

            <styles.FAQA>
              No, <code>{s}</code> is just a wrapper on top of{" "}
              <code>{rur}</code> that's all, React is still in charge of the
              state.

              Do this wrapper is a replacement for REDUX?
            </styles.FAQQ>
            <styles.FAQA>
              No, This is just a small package catering to small and medium
              components where <code>{rur}</code> plays better than regular{" "}
              <code>{rus}</code>; Remember is just <code>{rur}</code> with some
              sparkles on top of it ✨. <br />
              <strong>Redux</strong> instead is a battle tested library with a

              The React's documentation put it like this:
            </styles.FAQA>
            <blockquote>
              useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex
              state logic that involves{" "}
              <styles.Marker>multiple sub-values</styles.Marker> or{" "}
              <styles.Marker>
                when the next state depends on the previous one
              </styles.Marker>
              . useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components
              that <styles.Marker>trigger deep updates</styles.Marker> because
              you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.
